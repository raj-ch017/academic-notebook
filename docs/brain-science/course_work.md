Summary

This course will introduce learners to the fundamentals of neuroscience and the workings of individual neurons. Through interactive simulations, learners will build a neuron step by step and explore how neurons transmit information using electricity. In addition, learners will have the opportunity to visit a neuroscience lab at Harvard and gain practical knowledge on conducting DIY neuroscience experiments.
