[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) is a free and open collection of material from thousands of MIT courses, covering the entire MIT curriculum.

[MIT Opening Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library) is home to selected educational content from MIT OpenCourseWare and MITx courses, available to anyone in the world at any time. All material is free to use. Some resources, particularly those from MIT OpenCourseWare, are free to download, remix, and reuse for non-commercial purposes.

# Overview
This repository has been created to keep track of coursework that follows the undergraduate curriculum of MIT, with additional online courses from platforms like Coursera and Edx.

# Summary 
The objective is to have a formal introduction to the concepts that belong to the field of Brain Science. The structure upon which the coursework will be built is meant to be equivalent to an undergraduate education. 

The project will bring together two of my main interests:

  - Skills in computation to develop tools and methods that can be applied to a particular field
  - A formal knowledge base in Brain Science with introduction to areas of research in which computational skills and methods can be applied
  

However, I would like to have an emphasis that slightly leans toward [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/brain-cognitive-sciences-course-9/). 

# Curriculum
This will serve as a blueprint for taking courses according to the degree requirements. 

  
  ## 1. Brain and Cognitive Sciences
  
 To be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Science, students must have satisfactorily completed a program of study which includes the General Institute Requirements (GIRs) and the departmental program of the Course in which the degree is to be awarded.[^req]

  * The courses that have been highlighted in yellow represent the ones that will be completed as the four course requirement for electives in accordance with the curriculum requirement.
  * The courses that have been highlighted in orange represent the ones that will be completed irrespective of curriculum requirements.

# Resources
The resources are divided into two categories:

- MIT OpenCourseWare - Lectures provided in [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

- Courses - Resources gathered from online platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Edx](https://www.edx.org/)
