> Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain, and that even the least gifted may, like the poorest land that has been well cultivated and fertilized, produce an abundant harvest.” - Santiago Ramón y Cajal

As I type these words, I am reminded of the incredible complexity of the human brain. Though the act of typing may seem simple, there is so much more happening beneath the surface. Nerves send signals to muscles, while the brain works quietly in the background to ensure that my thoughts are translated into coherent words on the screen. It's truly amazing how our brains are able to perform such intricate tasks effortlessly. It also ensures that I follow the constructs of language instead of typing gibberish.
