Summary
{: .fs-6}
{: .fw-400}
{: .text-center}

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in mathematics** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all math disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate math majors, minus general education (non-math) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of math.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Match our [curricular guidelines](CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md) the 2015 CUPM Guide.
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical practice

When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.

**Duration**:
It is possible to finish the curriculum within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies.

**Cost**:
OSSU strives to identify free resources to reach your learning goal. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**:
Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses in order from top to bottom, as they have already been sorted by their prerequisites.
- Courses in Core Mathematics are the basic requirements for all OSSU Math students, and provide a foundation for deeper study. Take all of these courses.
- Courses in Advanced Topics are electives. Take one course in each topic area. Then choose one topic you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject (we recommend getting validation from the community on the subject you choose).

**Content policy**:
If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct that you sign in the beginning of each course!*

### Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
Most people's views of mathematics are destroyed in school by focusing on memorization and regurgitation. But mathematicians see math as an elegant way to explain the world around us. This class covers how to think like a mathematician and solve problems. 

**Topics covered:**
`Mathematical mindset`
`Number Theory`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
[Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) | 10 weeks | 4 hours/week | none

### Calculus 
Calculus is the study of infinity. As the cornerstone of geometry and physics, it serves as the foundation of our world, explaining the phenomena that underly our technology, our planets, and our hearts. 

**Topics Covered:**
`Derivatives`
`Integrals`
`Infinity`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:

[Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) | 12 weeks | 6 hours/week | Calculus 1C 

### Introduction to Differential Equations
Differential equations describe the science of change: the route by which natural and man-made systems move from one state to another. Epidemics, population growth, and weather patterns are all modeled using differential equations.

**Topics covered:**
`First-order ODEs`
`Second-order ODEs`
`Higher-order ODEs`
`Laplace Transforms`

:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
[Introduction to Differential Equations](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-differential-equations-2) | 14 weeks | 3-6 hours/week | Calculus 1C

### Discrete Mathematics
Discrete mathematics is the mathematics of objects and ideas. The topics discussed here also form the basis of the field of computer science. For mathematics majors, a discrete math course is usually also a first introduction to formal proofs. 

**Topics covered:**
`Counting`
`Grouping`
`Classifying`
`Logic and Reasoning`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:

### Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is the mathematics of spatial relationships. It provides an elegant way to consider many simultaneous equations, to visualize arbitrarily-many dimensions, and to explain complex phenomena in simple terms.

**Topics covered:**
`Vector and matrix calculations`
`Linear transformations`
`Vector spaces`
`Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:

[Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) | 14 weeks | 12 hours/week | Essence of Linear Algebra

### Probability & Statistics
Probability is the mathematics of uncertainty. Statistics is the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty in real-world data. These two related but distinct fields of study help us describe variation and uncertainty in the world around us. These courses make heavy use of discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and calculus, and serve as a first opportunity to apply what you've learned in the other core courses.

**Topics covered:**
`Random variables`
`Expectation and Variance`
`Probability Distributions`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites

[Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/) | 14 weeks | 12-16 hours/week | Probability

### Introduction to Analysis
Analysis is the mathematics of mathematics itself. Analysis makes extensive use of the formal proof to build important mathematical concepts from the ground up. Starting by proving the existence of real numbers, this course will show you how to create single-variable calculus entirely from scratch.

**Topics covered:**
`Proofs`
`Real analysis`

### Introduction to Abstract Algebra
Abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from older parts of algebra, and more specifically from elementary algebra, the use of variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning.

**Topics covered:**
`Group Theory`
`Rings and fields`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
