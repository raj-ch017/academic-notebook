Summarising the uncanny habit of Mathematics to describe nature:

  > How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought independent of experience, is so admirably adapted to the objects of reality? - Albert Einstien
  
***Does anybody have a clue as to why Mathematics represents nature and reality with precision?***

## Motivation:
 
The treatment of Mathematics as a subject introduced in school causes us to under celebrate it. Many people grow up to hate it, maybe because of the low grades they received or the fact that they failed to understand the concept of 'Exponentials and Logarithms' in grade 10. The misconception of Mathematics being a part of Science doesn't help the cause either.
 
Mathematics is the purest result of the human mind and its relation to abstraction. People from different cultures might meet and greet each other with "Hello" and "Namaste". But, both of them will understand (provided they have had the privilege of being educated) that if one of them has two pens in their pocket and the other person gives them two more pens, then the pocket will now consist of four pens.

Learning Mathematics is learning to speak the language of nature and understand its working, uncover hidden patterns and play around with ideas to develop an intimate relationship with nature. 

This repository has been built to keep track of the coursework that I complete in Mathematics. My primary motivation is to keep learning and improving my mathematical skills, which in turn improves my intuition and ability to deal with abstraction.
