Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science
{: .fs-7}
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-center}

You can check out the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof)

Summary

The course introduces the basic mathematical concepts that are applied in computation. The introduction focuses on breadth over depth. The course required basic programming knowledge as the topics were taught and tested using Python. 
The ideas were easily transferable to programming and helped to improve my programming skills. 

Topics include:

  * Recursion
  * Induction
  * Logic
  * Invariants

Introduction to Calculus
{: .fs-7}
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-center}

Course Link: [Introduction to Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-calculus)

Summary:

The focus and themes of the Introduction to Calculus course address the most important foundations for applications of mathematics in science, engineering and commerce. The course emphasises the key ideas and historical motivation for calculus, while at the same time striking a balance between theory and application, leading to a mastery of key threshold concepts in foundational mathematics.

18.01x - Single Variable Calculus
{: .fs-7}
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-center}

Series Link: [18.01x](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-18.01x-single-variable-calculus)

Overview:

In this series, you will learn the mathematical notation, physical meaning, and geometric interpretation of a variety of calculus concepts. Along with the fundamental computational skills required to solve these problems, you will also gain insight into real-world applications of these mathematical ideas.


Course 1 - Differentiation
{: .fs-6}
{: .text-center}

[Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation)

But what is the derivative? You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative. You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions. You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior. You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.
