Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science
{: .fs-7}
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-center}

You can check out the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-a-proof)

Summary

The course introduces the basic mathematical concepts that are applied in computation. The introduction focuses on breadth over depth. The course required basic programming knowledge as the topics were taught and tested using Python. 
The ideas were easily transferable to programming and helped to improve my programming skills. 

Topics include:

  * Recursion
  * Induction
  * Logic
  * Invariants
